This program moves a 4x4 box from the wasd inputs. The box will also change color from the
rgby & "space" inputs. Additionally, the box will automatically change color every 5 moves
and leaves a trail. The box will stay within the boundaries of the display and print: 
"WORMS CAN'T LEAVE!" if the box recieves an input to go past the boundary. "Enter" resets
the program & q halts the program.
